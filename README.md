# InequationLineSign
A really simple website to draw lines of inequations, and to think about its signs.

## Why
To solve an inequation, for example:    

x(3x-2) > 0

You may need to get two separate inequations:

a) x > 0

b) 3x - 2 > 0     ->     3x > 2

Now, you may need to put those points on a line, so that you can think if the values before 0, from 0 to 2, and after 2 make this inequation positive (since it must be above zero). This website allows you to have a really quick and simple rappresentation of this line, and enables you to take note if the result is positive or negative.
## What this tool does
This website allows you to put two values, where the first disequation and the second disequation start. It divides the line in three parts: 
- The first part will contain all the values that makes the inequality false for both.
- The second part will contain all the values that makes the inequality true only for the second inequation
- The third part will contain all the values that make the inequality true for both inequations

Click below (for the first line) or above (for the second line) to take note if the result of the x for that line is positive or negative. It'll be colored, and the website will calculate the final result. If you need that, you can export the line as a picture.
